# Iris Flower Classification

This project is completed as part of the CodeAlpha Data Science Internship.

## Objective
To classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)
based on sepal and petal measurements using a machine learning model.

## Approach
- Load and preprocess the Iris dataset
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Apply feature scaling
- Train a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier
- Evaluate the model using accuracy and confusion matrix

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Result
The model successfully classifies iris species with high accuracy.

## Status
Task completed successfully.
